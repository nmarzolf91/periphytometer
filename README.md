The .stl and .gcode files in this repository were developed in tandem with the Landscape Ecology Lab at The Jones Center at Ichauway (https://github.com/jbcannon). 

The slide holders are deployed in aquatic environments to measure algal biomass and pigments (chlorophyll a, b, c) following acetone extraction.
